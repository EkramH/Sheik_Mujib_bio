				<h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold">Juktofront Election</h3>
				<p class="py-4">On 14th November 1953, a decision was made to form a Juktofront with other parties to participate in the general election. In the general elections on March 10, 1954, the Juktofront won 223 of the 237 seats, of which the Awami Muslim League won 143 seats alone. Sheikh Mujib was passed from the Gopalganj constituency. He was given the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on May 15. On May 29, the central government disbanded the Juktofront. After returning from Karachi on May 30, he was detained at the airport. He was released on December 23 of that year. On 5th June 1955, Sheikh Mujib was nominated a member of the Legislative Council. On 17 June, the Awami Muslim League presented a 21-point demand in a rally at Paltan Maidan, which included the autonomy of East Pakistan.
				The term 'Muslim' was dropped from the party's name in a special session of Awami Muslim League on October 21-23 in 1955. Sheikh Mujib was re-elected secretary-general of the party. In the Awami League meeting with the chief minister on February 3, the demand to include autonomy in the draft constitution was proposed from the party.

				<h3 class="title text-center font-weight-bold">The election in 1970</h3>
				<p class="py-4">During the trial, on January 5, 1969, the Central Student Movement Parishad submitted their 11-point demand, which included six points of Sheikh Mujib. Following the decision of this council, mass agitation was begun demanding the withdrawal of the Agartala conspiracy case. This movement is known as the 69’s mass uprising. After the agitation, the case was withdrawn and all the accused including Sheikh Mujib were released. Sheikh Mujib was given the title of 'Bangabandhu' at a meeting of the central student movement council at the then Racecourse ground (Suhrawardy Udyan) on February 23 that year.
				At an all-party conference at the call of Ayub Khan in 1969, Sheikh Mujib called to recognize the demands of other political parties, including the six-point, and but was rejected and then he walked out the summit. In a meeting on the death anniversary of Suhrawardy on December 5, Sheikh Mujib declared that from now on, East Pakistan would be called 'Bangladesh'. Subsequently, Mujib was able to build huge public mandate in East Pakistan and by the year 1970 he had emerged as one of the most influential leaders of the Indian subcontinent.
				In the election in 1971, the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujib, won an absolute majority in the provincial legislature. The result of the elections creates polarization between the two parts of Pakistan. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the leader of the largest political party in West Pakistan, opposes Mujib's autonomy. He announced that he would not accept the government if President Yahya Khan called on Sheikh Mujib to form a government. Most West Pakistani army officers and Islamic political parties oppose Sheikh Mujib's incoming Prime Minister.</p>

				<p class="py-4">In the midst of political instability, Yahya was late to call Parliament. Bengalis understand that the Awami League, the party of Mujib, will not be allowed to form a government even though it has the majority. Sheikh Mujib called for independence at a rally at the Racecourse ground on March 7 and prepared the people for a total non-cooperation movement.
				Meanwhile, Yahya Khan issued martial law. Declaring the Awami League banned, he ordered to arrest Sheikh Mujib and other Awami League leaders. The Pakistani military launched Operation Searchlight on March 25 to suppress political and public dissatisfaction. When the operation was started, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced the independence of Bangladesh over wireless from his residence of Dhanmondi 32 on March 26, 1971.
				On that day, he was arrested and taken to West Pakistan and kept in a tight security in a Faisalabad jail.
				Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the President of Bangladesh Government and the Chief of the Armed Forces, established in Mujibnagar on April 17, 1971. In his absence, Deputy President Syed Nazrul Islam served as the temporary head of state.
				The Pakistan Army's operation to control the situation soon turned into violence and bloodshed. With the help of razakars, the Pakistani army attacked ordinary people including Bengali intellectuals, politicians and union leaders. East Bengal members working in the Pakistan army and police regiments declared a revolt and Awami League members formed the government of Bangladesh under the leadership of Tajuddin Ahmed in Kolkata.
				After nine months of the war, the Pakistani army surrendered on 16 December and the Awami League leaders formed the government back in Dhaka. The Pakistani government released Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib on January 8, 1972. He then met Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in New Delhi via London. He returned to Bangladesh on January 10 1972.</p>

				<p class="py-4">Sheikh Mujib, 14, was married to 3-year-old Begum Fazilatunnesa. After 9 years of marriage, Sheikh Mujib and Fazilutunnesa began their conjugal life in 1942. The couple was bestowed with two daughters and three sons. The daughters are Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana. The sons are Sheikh Kamal, Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Russell.
				The anti-liberation power wanted to destroy the spirit of the War of Liberation by killing the father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Although they conspired to erase Bangabandhu's name from history, the Bengali nation resisted it and brought the Awami League to power. The Awami League, led by his daughter Sheikh Hasina, formed the government three times in a row from 2009. Bangladesh is now on the highway of development, inspired by Mujib ideals. On the occasion of the birth centenary of this great leader, 'Mujibborsho' will be observed all over the world from March 17</p>
